# Covid19-Tracker

A live version can be found [here](https://daily-covid19-tracker.netlify.app/).

_This project was build with ReactJS._

## Overview

This Tracker gives a precise and up-to-date overview of the Covid19-/Corona-Virus outbreak since January 2020.

## Functionality

The current number of **Infected**, **Recovered** and **Dead** People is displayed depending on a global scale or for a country. <br/>
When looking at the global statistics, a graph is shown below covering the number of Infected and Dead People since January, 22nd 2020. <br/>
The number of infected, recovered and dead people can be selected for a specific country. Therefore a bar-chart covers the latest numbers.

## Data

This project uses the data from the API of [covid19.mathdroid.id](https://covid19.mathdro.id/api). <br/>
It contains the precise number of active cases for every number regarding Infected, Recovered and Dead People.<br/>
I don't guarantee the accuracy of the data.

## Acknowledgement

I programmed this project as an exercise for learning modern ReactJS from ground up with also using an API. Parts of this project are inspired from the very thorough [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/khJlrj3Y6Ls).
